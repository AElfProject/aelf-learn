The smart contract needs to be deployed on the chain before users can use it.

Run this command to deploy a contract.

```
aelf-deploy -a <Wallet_Address> -p <Wallet_Password> -c <Contract_Path>/<Contract_File>.dll.patched
```

Wait about 1-2 minutes. If deployment is successful, it will return the contract address.
