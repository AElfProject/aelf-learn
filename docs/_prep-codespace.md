The easiest way to get started is to use this repository template: https://github.com/AElfProject/aelf-devcontainer-template.

Click on the `Use this template` button and choose `Create a new repository`.

Type a suitable repository name and click `Create repository`.

Within the GitHub interface, click on `Code`, then choose `Codespaces`.

Click on the plus "+" sign to create a new Codespace.

After some time, your workspace will load with the contents of the repository, and you will be able to continue your development using GitHub Codespaces.
