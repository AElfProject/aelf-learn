# Project Setup

First, proceed to create a new project folder and navigate to the project root directory by running the following commands.

```bash title="Terminal"
mkdir lottery_game && cd lottery_game
```

Next, proceed to run the following command to create the Lottery Game project!

```bash title="Terminal"
dotnet new aelf -n LotteryGame
```

Proceed to open the project on your desired IDE (VSCode) and rename the existing **src/Protobuf/contract/hello_world_contract.proto** file to **lottery_game_contract.proto**!

With that, we have successfully created our project!
