# Deploy Lottery Game Smart Contract

In this step, we will be deploying our Lottery Game smart contract to the aelf Testnet Sidechain (tDVW)!

## Step 1: Building Smart Contract

To begin, let’s compile and build our smart contract!

Proceed to head over to the **lottery_game/src** directory and run the following command.

```bash title="Terminal"
dotnet build
```

You should see `LotteryGame.dll.patched` in the directory **lottery_game/src/bin/Debug/net.6.0**.

With our smart contract successfully compiled, we are now ready to deploy our smart contract!

## Step 2: Deploying Your Smart Contract

import DeploySmartContract from "@site/docs/\_deploy-smart-contract.md";

<DeploySmartContract/>

:::tip
ℹ️ Note: You are to copy the smart contract address ($CONTRACT_ADDRESS) as we will be referencing it in the next step!

## Step 3: Interacting with your Lottery Game Contract

### Step 3.1: Approving Smart Contract Spending
In order for you to interact with a smart contract on aelf, you are required to approve the spending of specific tokens from a specific smart contract. In this case, we want to approve our Lottery Game smart contract to spend tokens on our behalf.

```bash title="Terminal"
aelf-command send ASh2Wt7nSEmYqnGxPPzp4pnVDU4uhj1XW9Se5VeZcX2UDdyjx -a $WALLET_ADDRESS -p $WALLET_PASSWORD -e https://tdvw-test-node.aelf.io Approve
```

:::tip
`ASh2Wt7nSEmYqnGxPPzp4pnVDU4uhj1XW9Se5VeZcX2UDdyjx` is the contract address of Multitoken Contract on aelf Testnet Sidechain (tDVW).
:::   



Enter the following into the command to approve spending of 90 ELF tokens:

```bash title="Terminal"
Enter the params one by one, type `Enter` to skip optional param:
? Enter the required param <spender>: $CONTRACT_ADDRESS
? Enter the required param <symbol>: ELF
? Enter the required param <amount>: 9000000000
```

:::tip
You may interact with your contract through this tool: https://aelf-contract-view.vercel.app/

### Step 3.2: Initializing Lottery Game Contract

```bash title="Terminal"
aelf-command send $CONTRACT_ADDRESS -a $WALLET_ADDRESS -p $WALLET_PASSWORD -e https://tdvw-test-node.aelf.io Initialize
```

This command will initialize the contract and set your $WALLET_ADDRESS as the owner of the contract.

### Step 3.3: Depositing funds into the Lottery Game Contract

```bash title="Terminal"
aelf-command send $CONTRACT_ADDRESS -a $WALLET_ADDRESS -p $WALLET_PASSWORD -e https://tdvw-test-node.aelf.io Deposit
```

Enter a value in the console that you would like to deposit from your wallet. Remember that each token has different decimal values. For ELF, it has a decimal value of 8. This means that the value, 100,000,000, is equivalent to 1 ELF.

### Step 3.4: Playing the Lottery Game

```bash title="Terminal"
aelf-command send $CONTRACT_ADDRESS -a $WALLET_ADDRESS -p $WALLET_PASSWORD -e https://tdvw-test-node.aelf.io Play
```

Enter a value in the console that you would like to play with from your wallet. There is a 50% chance you might win each time you play!
