:::tip
If you are developing and testing this with GitHub codespace, you can use Port Forward to test the web server that is running in codespace, here is the link on how to use Port forward for codespace https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/forwarding-ports-in-your-codespace
:::

Usually codespace will automatically forward port, you should see a pop-up message at the bottom right of your codespace browser window as shown in the diagram below:

**Create Portkey Wallet**

:::info
Portkey is the first AA wallet from aelf's ecosystem, migrating users, developers and projects from Web2 to Web3 with DID solution.

Users can swiftly log into Portkey via their Web2 social info with no private keys or mnemonics required. Underpinned by social recovery and decentralized guardian design, Portkey safeguards users' assets from centralized control and theft. Portkey has a unique payment delegation mechanism which enables interested parties to function as delegatees to pay for user activities on users' behalf. This means that users can create accounts for free and fees for other usages may also be covered in Portkey.

Portkey also provides crypto on/off-ramp services, allowing users to exchange fiat with crypto freely. It supports the storage and management of various digital assets such as tokens, NFTs, etc. The compatibility with multi-chains and seamless connection to all kinds of DApps makes Portkey a great way to enter the world of Web3.

With DID solution as its core, Portkey provides both Portkey Wallet and Portkey SDKs.
