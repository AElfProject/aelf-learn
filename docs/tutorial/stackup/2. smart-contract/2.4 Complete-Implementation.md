# Complete Implementation

The following are the reference codes for JoinDAO and GetAllProposals.
You can check if your implementation matches the reference codes.

## Implementing Join DAO Function

Firstly, check if the passed address has already called the JoinDAO method; if it has, throw an exception. 
Otherwise, set `State.Members[input]` to true and increment MemberCount by 1.

```csharp showLineNumbers
public override Empty JoinDAO(Address input)
{
    // Based on the address, determine whether the address has joined the DAO. If it has, throw an exception
    Assert(!State.Members[input], "Member is already in the DAO");
    // If the address has not joined the DAO, then join and update the state's value to true
    State.Members[input] = true;
    // Read the value of MemberCount in the state, increment it by 1, and update it in the state
    var currentCount = State.MemberCount.Value;
    State.MemberCount.Value = currentCount + 1;
    return new Empty();
}
```

## Implementing Get All Proposals Function

Firstly, create a ProposalList object, then fetch and loop through the Proposals state variable and update the ProposalList object 
with the proposal objects and finally return the list of proposals!

```csharp showLineNumbers
public override ProposalList GetAllProposals(Empty input)
{
    // Create a new list called ProposalList
    var proposals = new ProposalList();
    // Start iterating through Proposals from index 0 until the value of NextProposalId, read the corresponding proposal, add it to ProposalList, and finally return ProposalList
    for (int i = 0; i < State.NextProposalId.Value; i++)
    {
        var proposal_count = i.ToString();
        var proposal = State.Proposals[proposal_count];
        proposals.Proposals.Add(proposal);
    }
    return proposals;
}
```
