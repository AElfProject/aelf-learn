# Unit Test Voting Smart Contract Logic

It is advice to create a Unit Text for the Smart Contract before it is deployed to the Aelf blockchain. The Unit Test not just help us to verify the Smart Contract is free from bugs, it is also gives us the opportunity to review our code before it is deployed.

In this step, we will be writing the unit test of our Voting Smart Contract in the **test/BuildersDAOTests.cs** file!

Proceed to overwrite the existing contents of **test/BuildersDAOTests.cs** file with the following code snippet.

```csharp showLineNumbers
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using AElf.Contracts.HelloWorld;
using Google.Protobuf.WellKnownTypes;
using Xunit;

namespace AElf.Contracts.BuildersDAO
{
    // This class is unit test class, and it inherit TestBase. Write your unit test code inside it
    public class BuildersDAOTest : TestBase
    {
        [Fact]
        // rename the following methond to ProposalTest
        // public async Task Update_ShouldUpdateMessageAndFireEvent()
        // highlight-next-line
        public async Task ProposalTest()
        {
            // The Initialize method is to initialize the Smart Contract
            await BuildersDAOStub.Initialize.SendAsync(new Empty());

            // After we have initialized the BuildsDAO smart contract, we simulate three participants by calling the JoinDAO methods three times with three different accounts
            await BuildersDAOStub.JoinDAO.SendAsync(Accounts[1].Address);
            await BuildersDAOStub.JoinDAO.SendAsync(Accounts[2].Address);
            await BuildersDAOStub.JoinDAO.SendAsync(Accounts[3].Address);

            // Creates a proposal with the first account
            var createProposalInput = new CreateProposalInput
            {
                Creator = Accounts[1].Address,
                Description = "proposal test",
                Title = "proposal test",
                VoteThreshold = 1
            };
            var proposal = await BuildersDAOStub.CreateProposal.SendAsync(createProposalInput);

            // Vote the created proposal with the three accounts
            var voteInput1 = new VoteInput
            {
                ProposalId = proposal.Output.Id,
                Vote = true,
                Voter = Accounts[1].Address
            };
            await BuildersDAOStub.VoteOnProposal.SendAsync(voteInput1);
            var voteInput2 = new VoteInput
            {
                ProposalId = proposal.Output.Id,
                Vote = true,
                Voter = Accounts[2].Address
            };
            await BuildersDAOStub.VoteOnProposal.SendAsync(voteInput2);
            var voteInput3 = new VoteInput
            {
                ProposalId = proposal.Output.Id,
                Vote = false,
                Voter = Accounts[3].Address
            };
            await BuildersDAOStub.VoteOnProposal.SendAsync(voteInput3);

            // Gets all the proposals. And check whether result is correct
            var proposalResult = await BuildersDAOStub.GetAllProposals.CallAsync(new Empty());
            proposalResult.Proposals[1].Id.ShouldBe(proposal.Output.Id);
            proposalResult.Proposals[1].YesVotes.ShouldContain(Accounts[1].Address);
            proposalResult.Proposals[1].YesVotes.ShouldContain(Accounts[2].Address);
            proposalResult.Proposals[1].NoVotes.ShouldContain(Accounts[3].Address);
        }
    }
}
```

After that, run `dotnet test` command to execute this unit test case, and check the result.

You should see the following output from terminal:

**Understanding the Code**

In this code snippet, we run the unit test with the following methods in sequence.

- **Initialize** -
  The Initialize method is to initialize the Smart Contract.

- **JoinDAO** -
  After we have initialized the BuildsDAO smart contract, we simulate three participants by calling the JoinDAO methods three times with three different accounts

- **CreateProposal** -
  Creates a proposal with the first account.

- **VoteOnProposal** -
  Vote the created proposal with the three accounts.

- **GetAllProposal** -
  Gets all the proposals.

We will then verify the steps with the **ShouldBe, ShouldContain** SDK methods with expected outcomes of the Unit Test.
